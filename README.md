# Fall-Detection-System
This is my 2020-2021 Final Year Project at Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education.

Now cities are slowly beginning to become an aging society, so we need to use some innovative technologies to help them in their daily lives and one category is their health. According to past statistics, falls are most likely to affect elderly injuries, especially elderly people living alone. After they were injured, they were unable to contact their family members. It becomes one of the most serious problems because the elderly cannot be helped and treated immediately, it becomes even more serious. Fall detection is a major challenge in the public healthcare domain, especially for the elderly as the decline of their physical fitness, and timely and reliable surveillance is necessary to mitigate the negative effects of falls. So we chose to build a fall detection system. So that the elderly living alone can be protected. Our project is designed to support the independent living of the elderly. The main goal of the project is reconstructing the userâ€™s posture to detect falls in real-time. 

Functionally, there will be a trained AI model which will detect the fall. The family can watch the life of the elderly through the live camera. The mobile app and website can view the records of the elderly who have fallen in the past. The family members will receive relevant notifications immediately after the elderly fall.
